# Carefree Calendar

## Summary

This web application serves as a dynamic daily scheduler to which the user can save events for each hour of the day during typical business hours. The date is displayed at the top of the page and the present hour is signified by the red timeblock. Past events appear in grey and future events appear in green. Saved events are stored in local storage so that they persist each time the application is opened in the browser, and the user can view and/or edit saved events or add new ones.

## Installation

Clone the repository from github to your local server. In terminal, type:

* git clone https://github.com/cnix273/carefree-calendar.git

## Usage

**Technologies Used**
* HTML - Used to create the structure of the site
* CSS - Used to style the HTML Elements
* Bootstrap - CSS, JS, & HTML library used to add structure and style to the application including the grid layout and responsiveness
* Font Awesome - CSS-based font and icon toolkit used in conjunction with Bootstrap to add font icons to elements
* jQuery - JS library used to make the site dynamic while simplifying HTML DOM traversal and manipulation
* Moment.js - JS library used for getting and displaying current date/time data
* GitHub - Hosts the repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages

The repository includes the index.html, script.js, and style.css files and the "assets" directory, which runs adjacent. Within the asset directory are the "css", "js", and "images" directories. The "css" directory contains the style.css file, the "js" directory contains the script.js file, and the "images" directory contains two image files.

Repository structure must be maintained for proper usage of the index.html file.
